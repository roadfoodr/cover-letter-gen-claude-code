# Cover Letter Refinement Feedback

Use this file to provide instructions for refining your cover letter. The refinement process will incorporate your feedback while maintaining the style and tone from your sample letters.

## Instructions

Provide your refinement instructions below. Be specific about what you'd like to change, add, or emphasize.

### Examples of good feedback:

- "Emphasize my experience with cloud infrastructure more prominently in the second paragraph"
- "Add a sentence about my passion for open-source contributions"
- "Make the opening paragraph more concise - it's currently too long"
- "Remove the mention of [specific technology] and replace it with [alternative]"
- "The closing paragraph feels too generic - make it more specific to this company's mission"
- "Shorten the overall letter by about 50 words while keeping the key points"
- "Make the tone slightly more formal" (only if you want to deviate from sample letter style)
- "Add more specific metrics from my resume in the third paragraph"

### What to include:

- **Content changes**: What to add, remove, or modify
- **Emphasis**: What points to highlight more or less
- **Length**: If you want the letter shorter or longer
- **Tone adjustments**: Only if you want to deviate from your sample letter style
- **Specific details**: Any particular experiences, skills, or achievements to include or exclude
